== SMTP Error Messages ==

= Communication Error [334] make sure the Envelope From Email is the same account used to create the Client ID. =

* This is almost always caused by being logged in to Google/Microsoft/Yahoo with a different user than the one Post is configured to send mail with. Logout and try again with the correct user

* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use SSL over port 587. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Operation Timed out =

* Your host may have installed a firewall (DROP packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use TLS over port 465. Check your encryption and port settings.

* Ensure you are using the correct SMTP server with authentication - the correct SMTP server is the one defined by your email service's SPF record
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add an [SPF record](http://www.openspf.org/Introduction) to your DNS zone file. The SPF is specific to your email provider, for example [Google](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786)
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add a DKIM record to your DNS zone file and upload your Domain Key (a digital signature) to, for example [Google]((https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en))
